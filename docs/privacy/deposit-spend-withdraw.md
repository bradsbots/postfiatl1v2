# Deposit, Spend, Withdraw

PostFiat's current shielded flow has three production-shaped operations:

1. transparent-to-Orchard deposit;
2. Orchard private spend;
3. Orchard-to-transparent withdraw.

## Shielded Action Structure

A shielded action exposes enough data for consensus verification while keeping
the spent note, owner, amount, asset details, and memo inside the proof.

    Root[anchor root<br/>accepted commitment root]
    Nullifier[nullifier<br/>double-spend prevention]

  end

## Turnstile Accounting

The transparent and shielded states meet at a turnstile. Supply integrity is
checked with public counters in addition to proof verification.

```mermaid

  subgraph Transparent[Transparent state]
    Accounts[Account balances<br/>public and auditable]
  end

  subgraph Shielded[Shielded pool]
    Deposits[Net deposits<br/>cumulative value entering]
    Withdrawals[Cumulative withdrawals<br/>value exiting]
    Notes[Note commitment tree<br/>plus nullifier set]
  end

  Accounts -->|deposit burns transparent principal| Deposits
  Deposits --> Notes
  Notes -->|private spend| Notes
  Notes -->|withdraw reveals recipient envelope| Withdrawals
  Withdrawals -->|credit transparent recipient| Accounts

  Invariant[Turnstile invariant<br/>cumulative withdrawals <= net deposits<br/>a breaking action is rejected<br/>no automatic pause]
  Deposits -. counter input .-> Invariant
  Withdrawals -. counter input .-> Invariant
```

An action that would break the turnstile is rejected with a receipt and
changes no pool state; in an atomic batch the whole batch is aborted. Examples
are a withdraw above the issued pool value (`orchard_withdraw_exceeds_pool`),
new notes beyond the recorded deposit budget (`turnstile_insufficient_deposit`)
and an Asset-Orchard egress above an asset's live balance
(`asset_orchard_accounting_underflow`). A rejection pauses nothing: shielded
actions stop only when governance activates the Orchard pool pause amendment,
which then rejects every action in a shielded batch with `orchard_pool_paused`.

Code: `orchard_withdraw_amount_for_apply`,
`apply_verified_orchard_action_to_shielded_state_with_exit_policy_and_deposit_credit`
and `debit_asset_orchard_balance` in `crates/node/src/orchard_state_application.rs`;
`verify_orchard_turnstile_accounting` in `crates/node/src/shielded_batch_actions.rs`;
`execute_shielded_batch_actions` in `crates/node/src/execution_actions.rs`.

## Deposit

A deposit envelope contains a signed transparent funding transfer to the
protocol burn sink and an Orchard/Halo2 output action. The Orchard action binds
the funding transfer id, amount, fee, policy id, and disclosure hash into the
authorization domain.

Accepted apply:

- verifies funding signature and sequence;
- burns transparent principal plus deposit resource fee;
- mints the Orchard note;
- updates pool roots and public counters;
- leaves the recipient note scan-spendable.

## Spend

`orchard-spend-create` builds a real Orchard spend from one decrypted note. It
can send full value minus fee or send an amount plus default change.

Accepted apply:

- verifies the Orchard proof;
- persists the nullifier;
- appends output commitments;
- burns the signed fee;
- rejects duplicate nullifiers.

## Withdraw

`orchard-withdraw-create` builds a one-note withdraw action bound to a
transparent recipient envelope.

Accepted apply:

- verifies the external binding;
- nullifies the spent note;
- burns the signed fee;
- credits the transparent recipient in the same committed block.
