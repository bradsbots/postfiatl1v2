# Addresses And Checksums

This page specifies the PFTL account address, its optional mixed-case
checksum, and how nodes validate destination addresses. Exchanges and wallets
should implement the parser below and test it against the published vectors.

## Canonical address

```text
address = "pf" + lowercase_hex(SHA3-384("postfiat.address.v1" || 0x00 || ml_dsa_65_public_key)[0..20])
```

- The address is always 42 characters: `pf` and 40 hex characters.
- The canonical form is all lowercase. It is the only form stored on chain,
  used as a ledger key, and accepted in a signed transaction.
- There is no BIP32-style public derivation. Each deposit address comes from
  its own ML-DSA-65 key.

Source: `address_from_public_key` in `crates/crypto_provider/src/lib.rs`.

## Checksum specification

The checksum is an optional mixed-case display encoding of the same 40 hex
characters. It follows EIP-55 but uses this chain's SHA3 family and its own
domain tag. It changes no bytes on chain.

```text
hex = the 40 lowercase hex characters after "pf"
h   = SHA3-256("postfiat.address.checksum.v1" || 0x00 || ascii(hex))
for i in 0..40:
    nibble = (i even) ? h[i/2] >> 4 : h[i/2] & 0x0f
    out[i] = (hex[i] in 'a'..'f' and nibble >= 8) ? uppercase(hex[i]) : hex[i]
checksummed = "pf" + out
```

- The prefix is never uppercased and is not part of the hashed input.
- An address with no letters is its own checksummed form.
- SHA3-256 is FIPS 202 SHA3, not Keccak-256.

Example: `pfb385030ad80e5f7a59ec93b71f11055e9ccb9230` is displayed as
`pfb385030Ad80e5F7a59EC93b71f11055E9cCb9230`.

## Parsing rules

A parser takes human input and returns the canonical lowercase address, or
rejects it with one reason. Rules are checked in this order:

| Rule | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| The first two characters must be exactly `pf`. `PF`, `Pf` and `pF` are rejected. | `uppercase_prefix`, otherwise `missing_prefix` |
| No non-ASCII character may follow the prefix. | `non_hex` |
| The address must be exactly 42 characters. | `wrong_length` |
| Every character after the prefix must be `0-9`, `a-f` or `A-F`. | `non_hex` |
| All-lowercase hex is accepted as the legacy, canonical form. | |
| Hex that contains any uppercase letter is accepted only if it equals the checksummed form exactly. All-uppercase hex is rejected. | `bad_checksum` |

The first four reasons mean the address is malformed. `bad_checksum` is a
separate error, so a wallet can say "this address has a typo" rather than
"this is not an address". Parsers do not trim whitespace; trim pasted text
before parsing.

Implementations:

- Rust: `parse_address`, `checksum_address`, `validate_canonical_address` and
  `display_address` in `crates/crypto_provider/src/address.rs`.
- JavaScript: `wallet-extension/lib/address.js`, with a self-contained
  SHA3-256.
- Python: `python/postfiat_rpc/address.py`.

## Test vectors

[pftl-address-vectors-v1.json](../fixtures/addresses/pftl-address-vectors-v1.json)
lists valid addresses in both forms (six derived from fixed ML-DSA-65 seeds),
wrong checksums, and malformed inputs with their expected reason. The Rust, JS
and Python test suites all read this file.

## Destination validation

A destination field is any field that credits an account: `transfer.to`,
`payment.to`, `issued_payment.to`, `nav_mint_at_nav.to`,
`vault_bridge_mint_from_receipts.to`, `vault_bridge_deposit_claim.recipient`,
`vault_bridge_nav_subscription_allocate.nav_recipient`,
`pftl_uniswap_primary_redeem.settlement_recipient`,
`pftl_uniswap_return_import.pftl_recipient`, `escrow_create.recipient`,
`nft_mint.owner` and `nft_transfer.to`. Atomic-swap leg recipients were
already validated as canonical addresses by the transaction envelope.

A destination field must be canonical. A correctly checksummed value is still
rejected in a signed transaction, because a mixed-case string is a different
ledger key. Wallets normalize with the parser before quoting and signing.

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `invalid_recipient_address` | The value is not `pf` + 40 hex characters. |
| `invalid_recipient_checksum` | The value uses uppercase hex that does not match its checksum. |
| `noncanonical_recipient_address` | The value is correctly checksummed, but a signed transaction must carry the lowercase form. |

The check runs in two places:

1. **Admission (local policy, active on upgrade).** The RPC server and mempool
   admission reject the transaction before it is stored. The RPC error `code`
   is one of the codes above, and the message names the field. Source:
   `rpc_serve_destination_address_rejection` in
   `crates/node/src/atomic_swap_rpc_server.rs` and
   `ensure_destination_addresses_admissible` in
   `crates/node/src/mempool_proposals.rs`.
2. **Execution (consensus, governed).** Block execution applies the same rule
   from the governance-scheduled `recipient_format_activation_height`. Without
   that amendment the rule is inactive, so historical blocks replay unchanged.
   Source: `crates/execution/src/recipient_format.rs`.

From the activation height, a block that contains such a transaction records a
rejected receipt with the code above. Before the separately governed
`rejected_tx_fee_activation_height`, it charges no fee and consumes no sequence.
After that gate, an authenticated, correctly sequenced transaction that can pay
its fee is charged and receives `tec_invalid_recipient_address`,
`tec_invalid_recipient_checksum` or `tec_noncanonical_recipient_address`. The
recipient receives nothing. RPC and mempool refusals always remain uncharged.

## Activation

The activation height is a governance amendment of kind
`recipient_format_activation_height` whose value is the first enforced block
height.

- It must be scheduled strictly after the block that applies it.
- The earliest unpaused scheduled height wins, so a later amendment cannot
  postpone or disable the rule.
- Every validator must run a release that knows this kind before the
  amendment is submitted.

```bash
postfiat-node ratify-recipient-format-activation-height --data-dir PATH \
  --validators CSV --height H --amendment-file recipient-format.unsigned.json
# each validator
postfiat-node governance-authorization-sign --data-dir PATH \
  --amendment-file recipient-format.unsigned.json --validator NODE_ID \
  --validator-key-file PATH --proposal-slot S --expires-at-height E \
  --authorization-file NODE_ID.authorization.json
postfiat-node governance-amendment-assemble --data-dir PATH \

  --proposal-slot S --output recipient-format.signed.json

  --key-file PATH --artifact-dir PATH
```

## Display

Human-facing surfaces show the checksummed form. Machine fields stay canonical.

- The RPC `account` result keeps `address` and adds `address_checksummed`.
- `postfiat-rpc-sdk wallet-identity` and `postfiat-node wallet-keygen` and
  `wallet-restore` reports add `address_checksummed`.
- The Chrome extension shows the checksummed form. It copies, stores and signs
  the canonical form, and accepts either form in the send field.
- `python -m postfiat_rpc.pftl_transfer address ADDRESS` prints both forms.
  `send` and `faucet` accept either form for `--to` and sign the canonical form.
