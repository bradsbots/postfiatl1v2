# Custody And Exchange

Custody and exchange support has two tracks:

1. transparent post-quantum account operations;
2. shielded Orchard workflows with scanning, disclosure, and policy review.

## Transparent Track

- account creation;
- fee quote;
- signed transfer;
- receipt/finality verification;
- account history and reconciliation.

## Addresses

- Signed transactions and on-chain state use only the canonical lowercase
  address, `pf` + 40 hex characters.
- Wallets may display and accept an optional mixed-case checksum.
- Nodes reject malformed destination addresses at RPC submission and mempool
  admission, and at execution from a governed activation height.

The format, checksum algorithm, error codes and test vectors are in
[Addresses And Checksums](address-format.md).

## Fees

Fees are burned, never paid to validators. A transaction declares its fee; the
minimum is 1 atom per started 512 bytes of signed transaction weight (at least
1), plus 10 atoms when a native payment creates its recipient account. Every
account keeps a 10-atom reserve. Use the `*_fee_quote` RPC methods to get the
exact minimum before signing.

### Rejected transactions pay their fee

From the governed `rejected_tx_fee_activation_height`, a transaction included
in a certified block that is validly signed, uses the account's next sequence
and can pay its fee while keeping the reserve, but whose effect fails, is
charged like XRPL `tec` results:

- the receipt has `accepted: false` and code `tec_<reason>`, for example
  `tec_insufficient_funds` or `tec_destination_memo_required`;
- `fee_charged` and `fee_burned` equal the declared fee, which left the
  sender's balance and was burned;
- the sender's sequence advanced, and nothing else changed (no amount moved).

Never charged: malformed envelopes, a wrong chain, genesis, protocol, address
namespace or transaction kind, failed authentication (algorithm, key or
signature), a sequence other than the next one, a fee below the minimum, a fee
the sender cannot pay while keeping the reserve, an expired atomic swap, and a
transaction that uses a feature not active at that height. These keep their
plain code, change nothing, and do not consume the sequence.

Reconciliation: an `account_tx` row whose `receipt_code` starts with `tec_`
debited `fee` from `from` and consumed `sequence`; it did not credit `to`.
Before resubmitting a withdrawal that came back `tec_`, sign it again with
the next sequence.

## Deposit Attribution With Required Memos

An account can require a memo on incoming payments (XRPL `RequireDest`). The
owner sets or clears the flag with a signed `account_set` asset transaction:

```json
{"operation": "account_set", "account": "<address>", "set_flags": 1, "clear_flags": 0}
```

Flag `1` is `require_memo`; clear it with `"set_flags": 0, "clear_flags": 1`.
In Python, `set_require_memo(client, wallet=wallet, enabled=True)` quotes,
signs and submits it. The `account` RPC returns `"flags": 1` while the flag is
set and omits `flags` when it is clear.

While the flag is set, these payments to the account are rejected with
`destination_memo_required` unless they carry at least one memo:

| Payment kind | Can carry a memo | To a flagged account |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `payment_v2` (native PFT) | yes, up to 4 | needs at least 1 memo |
| `issued_payment_v2` (issued asset) | yes, up to 4 | needs at least 1 memo |
| `transparent_transfer` (native PFT) | no | always rejected |
| `issued_payment` (issued asset) | no | always rejected |

`issued_payment_v2` is `issued_payment` plus the `payment_v2` memo list; Python
`send_issued_asset(..., memo_data=...)` uses it. Not covered: escrow, atomic
swap, offer, NFT, bridge and FastPay credits, which carry no memo. Do not
advertise those as deposit routes to a memo-requiring omnibus address. A
rejected memo-less payment is fee-claimed once the rejected-fee gate is also
active, and honest mempools refuse it at admission without charging.

Put the customer tag in `memo_data` (lowercase hex) and attribute a deposit by
the memo in the finalized transaction; `account_tx` rows carry `memo_count`
and the same `memo_hash` for native and issued-asset payments, plus signed
`memos` with optional UTF-8 text in both `account_tx` and `tx`.

## Activation

Both rules are consensus changes behind governance activation heights. Before
the height, execution, receipts and state roots are unchanged, so existing
blocks replay identically.

| Governance kind | Enables | Ratify command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rejected_tx_fee_activation_height` | fee claim on rejected transactions | `postfiat-node ratify-rejected-tx-fee-activation-height` |
| `require_memo_activation_height` | `account_set`, `issued_payment_v2`, memo enforcement | `postfiat-node ratify-require-memo-activation-height` |

Each height must be strictly after the block that commits its amendment. The
latest committed amendment of each kind sets the height, so governance can
postpone a height that has not been reached.

## Shielded Track

- receive/view key management;
- deposit address management;
- scan-only monitoring;
- selective disclosure;
- withdrawal review;
- policy and compliance workflows.
